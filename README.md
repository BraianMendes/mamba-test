## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Build and start the Docker containers**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    npm run start:dev
    ```

    This will start the backend server on port `3001` and set up the database.

3. **API Documentation**:
    The API routes and their documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:3001/api`.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The frontend application will attempt to connect to the backend API at `http://localhost:3001`. If the backend is not available, the frontend will use mocked data through the `useContext` API.

- **List Campaigns**: Displays all campaigns.
- **Create Campaign**: Form to create a new campaign.
- **Edit Campaign**: Edit an existing campaign.
- **Delete Campaign**: Soft delete a campaign.
- **View Campaign Details**: Detailed view of a single campaign.
